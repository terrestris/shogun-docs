# Admin-Client
***

The [Admin-Client](https://shogun2022.intranet.terrestris.de/admin) is used to create individual Web-GIS applications. You can define which layers should initially be available for an application, which users should have access to the application and which tools are available. In addition, further styling settings can be made and the resolution as well as the projection can be set.

Only users with the Admin role have access to the Admin-Client and can create or modify Web-GIS applications.

After successfully logging in, the administrator sees the dashboard on the right-hand side, which lists the existing entities (applications, topics and users) in brief. The desired entry can be selected directly by clicking on an entry in the respective lists.
