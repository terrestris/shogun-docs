# GIS-Client
***
The [GIS-Client](https://shogun2022.intranet.terrestris.de/client) is basically the interface for all users of the **SHOGun** Web-GIS application. There can be an undefinable number of individual applications, each of which can be accessed via an individual URL. The individual applications can be created and defined in the **Admin-Client**.

Users with the role **USER** and **Admin** have full access to all functionalities within the Web-GIS application. This includes all tools selected in the admin client. Unauthorized users have no access to the applications.
