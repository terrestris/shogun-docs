# Share
***
The Share function is used to share the current status of a Web GIS instance. A new URL is created that stores information about it:

- the zoom level
- the map extent
- selected layers

As long as the layers are available under their URL or in the internal GeoServer, the permalink URL is valid.

The permalink can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on the button behind the link.

:::info

A layer sequence changed by the user is not transferred to the permalink.

:::info

Note that you must be logged in to open the URL and that you must have access to the specific application.
