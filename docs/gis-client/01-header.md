# Header
***
The header contains the logo and the title of the application on the left side.

The search bar is located in the middle of the header.

In the right-hand corner of the header the user icon with the option to log out of the application is located.

## Search bar

The search includes a location search based on NOMINATIM.

To initiate a search query, a search term must be entered in the search field. The search then starts automatically. 

A search term that has already been entered can be removed using the gis-client icon at the end of the search bar. The search term and the results are reset.

If results are found for the search terms entered, the results display opens below the search bar.

By clicking on the title of a search result, the map zooms to the spatial extent of the result.

## User information

The user icon in the right corner gives the option to log out from the application.

It is also possible to get a version info for the system or to edit the user profile.
