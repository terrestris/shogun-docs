# Footer
***
Various information is available in the footer of the application.

## Scale information

Information on the scale of the map is displayed in the footer on the left, firstly as a scale bar and secondly as a numerical indication of the currently active scale. Here the user has the option of selecting a different value from the drop-down list by clicking on the number. It is also possible to enter the desired scale by typing it directly into the text field. Please note that only the scale number at the back, e.g. 50,000, must be entered without the leading "1 :". Only the available scales from the drop-down list are available as input scales.

## Reference system and current mouse position

In addition to the scale information in the footer, the reference system and the current mouse position are displayed if the mouse is positioned in an area of the main map.

## Contact, imprint and privacy policy

In the right-hand corner of the footer you will find the links for contact, imprint and privacy policy. Click on one of the links to open the desired content in a new browser page.
