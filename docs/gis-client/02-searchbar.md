# Searchbar
***

The search bar is located in the header of the application. The search allows you to search for locations based on NOMINATIM.

To initiate a search query, at least the first three letters of the search term must be entered in the search field. The search then starts automatically. This can be recognised by a small activity indicator at the back of the search field. This is displayed until the search results can be displayed.

A search term that has already been entered can be removed using the ![gis-client](/img/suche_x.png) icon at the end of the search bar. The search including hits is then reset.

### Show search results

If results are found for the search terms entered, the results display opens below the search bar in a list.

If you click on the title of a search hit, the map zooms in on the spatial extent of the result.
