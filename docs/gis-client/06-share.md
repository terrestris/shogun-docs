# Toolbox: Share
***
The share function is used to share the current state of an Web-GIS instance. A new URL will be created that stores information about:

- the zoom level
- the map section
- selected layers

As long as the layers are available under their URL or within the internal GeoServer the Permalink URL will be valid.

### Steps:
- create a selection of WMS services (including processed results)
- zoom to a specific map section
- use the share function in the toolbar to generate a permalink
- open that link in a new tab

:::info

Beware that you need to be logged in to open the URL.
